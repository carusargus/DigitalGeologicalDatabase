Notes: 
+ Added the simple Earthquake and populated it with five instances near to EP.
+ Added the ObjProp hasInterestLocation to relate earthquakes to the location of the project(s) for which we are using them. In this case, I mapped to Cristo_Rey
+ Corrected Cerozoic for Cenozoic. Cascaded to all elements which refered to it.
+ Populated the stratigraphic units with almost-true lat, long and altitude
